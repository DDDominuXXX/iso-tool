# mkiso

`mkiso` is a command that generates a minimal linux
OS with customized features.
It creates an ISO image that can be written directly
to a USB stick or hard drive.

Don't run it without reading it. You'll have to
adapt some things to your convenience. I plan to 
separate the configuration and improve the detection
and build system to let more customization and
automation to be done without effort (less wold be a
better word instead).
